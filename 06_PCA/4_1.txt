The names of these dimensions are: radius_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean, radius_worst, perimeter_worst and area_worst.

These dimensions correlate the best with the first diemension as they all are about the 2D dimensions of the features, which can explain a certain link between each of these relations and the first dimension.
