I don't expect the batch to be exactly (0, 1, -1), as this is an estimate the data will probably not give the exact mean.
To make this estimate more accurate, we could increase the number of points to get more samples in our batch.
We could also decrease the deviation as this would result in less gap in-between our data samples.
